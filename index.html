  <div class="intro">It's easy to get stuck in an echo chamber, especially if your friends tend to believe the same things you do, or if you get your news from only one or two places. This can make it hard to see other people's points of view and understand their decisions. Assorted News collects an assortment of the latest news stories from a varied range of sources to help burst your filter bubble. Try to read something you wouldn't normally choose.
